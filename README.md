# SMART-WHEELCHAIR-FOR-SPECIALLY-ABLED-PEOPLE-NATIONAL-LEVEL-HACKATHON-WINNER
Smart Wheelchair with Intelligent Path Planning We developed a next-generation Smart Wheelchair System aimed at transforming mobility for individuals with physical disabilities. The solution integrated cutting-edge hardware and software components to ensure safe, autonomous, and user-friendly navigation.


📱 Features of the System:
Voice-Controlled Navigation – Seamless voice input for hands-free operation
Gyro-Based Steering – Tilt controls using smartphone orientation sensors
Touch Interface – Simple UI for alternative manual input
Joystick Hardware Control – Direct control for advanced users
🛡️ Intelligence & Safety Integrations:
Ultrasonic Obstacle Avoidance
Accelerometer-Based Fall Detection
Emergency SOS Alert System (with real-time location)
Autonomous Path Planning Algorithm for optimized route finding


🔧 My Core Contributions:
Led the mobile app development, integrating voice, gyro, and touch-based controls.
Built the Path Planning Algorithm for real-time indoor navigation.
Developed critical safety features like Fall Detection and Emergency SOS.
Collaborated on hardware-software integration for seamless wheelchair control.
Played a key role in system design, testing, and final deployment under intense time constraints.
